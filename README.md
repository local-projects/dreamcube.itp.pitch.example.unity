# DreamCube Boilerplate Project

This program known as the _Pitch_ is the main software component needed to run for the _DreamCube's_ interactive virtual reality room. The main attraction is an arcade-style ball game using a physical ball tracked in three-dimensions. This repo contains two simple example scenes for modes of interaction.

This project relies on [dreamcube.pitch-app-core](https://github.com/local-projects/dreamcube.pitch-app-core.unity) repo as a submodule.
Fork this repo and build a new DreamCube experience.

**WARNING: DO NOT make changes to any of the Base Scenes, or Main scene.   
Those are critical for running your project in the DreamCube**

<!-- Installation -->

## Installation

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Fork the repo
2. Rename the repo (To your project name)
3. Clone your fork `git clone [your forks name]`
4. Load the core submodule `git submodule --init --recursive`
5. Set the configuration file:
=======
1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/local-projects/dreamcube.itp.pitch.example.unity.git
cd dreamcube.itp.pitch.example.unity
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Set the configuration file:
>>>>>>> f3b3d2e63e5c1c2f2ea60ab9c77721036c4f104a

An external settings file is required. It's located at `StreamingAssets\general_config.json`.
If the file does not exist it will be created using the default values at first run.

`Debug` - Whether the app is in debug mode <br />
`RTLSLocalIP` - IP of the computer's NIC running this software to which you want to bind RTLS <br />
`RTLSRemoteIP` - IP of the RTLS Server <br />
`RTLSPort` - Port of the RTLS <br />
`LogDirectory` - Serilog file directory <br />
`LogLevel` - Serilog minimum log level <br />
`LogName` - Serilog base file name and extension <br />
`UseASIO`- Audio output to the DSP <br />
`ASIODriverIndex`- Audio output Index <br />
`AsioAutoDetectName` - Audio output name <br />
`DSPBufferLength` - DSP Buffer length <br />
`DSPBufferCount` - DSP Buffer Count <br />

<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->
## Troubleshooting

_The program does not show on the correct displays._<br />
In the Windows or GPU display manager, the displays should be tiled left to right with indices 1-4. Display 1 should set to the `primary screen`.

For more detail, you should refer to the ~~Dreamcube Handbook~~
